# Webpack Practice Project

## Description

This project serves as a practical practice for mastering the Webpack build tool and its fundamental concepts, such as plugins, loaders, and service workers. The project is structured into two parts:

- **Client Side**: A vanilla JavaScript application using SASS and HTML, rendering a simple webpage with event listeners.
- **Server Side**: An Express.js server that handles requests from the client side.
